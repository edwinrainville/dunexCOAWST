# dunexCOAWST

This repository contains all the files to run a coupled ROMS and SWAN model through the COAWST framework to simulate the 
nearshore environment during the DUNEX (DUring Nearshore Events eXperiment) under different forcing scenarios. Th main goals are to understand wave breaking parameterizations. 

Model Setups:
1. Mission 19 (base case with small waves)
2. Mission 21 (large waves but similar period and direction as mission 19)
3.
